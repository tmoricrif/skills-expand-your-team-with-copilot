# Using Issue Templates

This guide explains how to use issue templates to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system.

## What are Issue Templates?

Issue templates are simple forms that help you provide all the information needed when requesting changes. They guide you through filling in the details so that changes can be made quickly and correctly.

## How to Use Issue Templates

1. **Go to the Issues page** in GitHub
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Choose the template** that best matches what you need:
   - **Add New Activity** - When you want to add a new extracurricular activity
   - **Modify Activity Details** - When you need to change an existing activity's schedule, description, or capacity
   - **Bug Report** - When something isn't working correctly
   - **UI/Design Change** - When you want to change how the website looks
   - **New Feature Request** - When you want to add new capabilities to the system

4. **Fill out the form** - Answer all required fields (marked with a red asterisk *)
5. **Submit the issue** - Click "Submit new issue" when you're done

## Available Templates

### 1. Add New Activity
Use this when you want to add a brand new extracurricular activity to the system.

**You'll need to provide:**
- Activity name
- Description of what students will do
- Meeting days (Monday through Sunday)
- Start and end times (in 24-hour format, like 15:30 for 3:30 PM)
- Maximum number of participants

**Example:** Adding a new "Yoga Club" that meets on Wednesdays from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM

### 2. Modify Activity Details
Use this when you need to change something about an existing activity.

**You can change:**
- Activity description
- Schedule (days or times)
- Maximum participants
- Activity name

**Example:** Changing Chess Club to meet on Tuesdays instead of Mondays

### 3. Bug Report
Use this when something isn't working the way it should.

**You'll describe:**
- What's not working
- What should happen instead
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Where the problem occurs
- How often it happens

**Example:** Students can't sign up for Soccer Team - the button doesn't work

### 4. UI/Design Change
Use this when you want to change how the website looks or is arranged.

**You can request changes to:**
- Colors
- Text size or fonts
- Layout and positioning
- Button appearance
- Images
- Mobile/tablet display

**Example:** Making the activity card text larger so it's easier to read

### 5. New Feature Request
Use this when you want to add completely new functionality to the system.

**You'll describe:**
- What new feature you want
- Why it's needed
- How it should work
- Who would use it

**Example:** Adding the ability to download a list of all students in an activity

## Tips for Success

1. **Be specific** - The more details you provide, the easier it is to implement your request correctly
2. **Use exact names** - When referring to activities, use the exact name as it appears in the system
3. **Use 24-hour time format** - For times, use formats like:
   - 07:00 for 7:00 AM
   - 15:30 for 3:30 PM
   - 19:00 for 7:00 PM
4. **One request per issue** - If you need multiple changes, create separate issues for each one
5. **Check existing issues** - Before creating a new issue, check if someone else has already requested the same thing

## What Happens After You Submit?

1. Your issue will be reviewed
2. A Copilot coding agent may be assigned to implement your request
3. You'll be notified when work begins and when it's completed
4. You can ask questions or provide clarification in the issue comments
